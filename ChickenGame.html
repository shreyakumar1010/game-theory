                <strong>Introduction</strong>
                <h4><br>There is a game called Chicken, in which two people drive two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends of a long straight road. If one of them swerves before the other, he is called a chicken. Of course, if neither swerves, they will crash.
                    <br>The worst possible payoff is to crash into each other, so we assign this a value 0.
                    <br><br>The best payoff is to have your opponent be the chicken, so we assign this a value 3. The next to worst possibility is to be the chicken, so we assign this a value 1. The last possibility is that both drivers swerve. Then, neither has less honor than the other, so this is preferable to being the chicken.
                    However, it is not quite as good as being the victor, so we assign it a value 2.
                    <br>Unlike the prisoner's dilemma, mutual defection is the worst outcome in chicken.
                    <br>Both players want to do the opposite of what the other player does.
                    </h4>
                <h4>The version of chicken with more than two players is known as the volunteer's dilemma. In a volunteer's dilemma, one player needs to take an action that will benefit all of the players.
                    The game has also been used to describe the mutual assured destruction of nuclear warfare, especially the sort of brinkmanship involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis.</h4>
                <h4><br>No player has a preferred strategy, and all players are in direct rivalry with one another.
                    Unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma, there are no dominating strategies, and this makes a big difference.
                    The best strategy is to anti-coordinate with your opponent; that is, to Defect when they Cooperate and Cooperate when they Defect.
                    <br><br>But if you had a choice, you would prefer to be the one Defecting. Mutual Defection is the worst outcome and isn't an equilibrium, but neither is Mutual Cooperation.
                    In fact, the equilibria are when you and your partner anti-coordinate and is inherently adversarial.
                    <br><br>While it is true that the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Chicken have a different preferential ordering of outcomes and thus different equilibria, the purposes of the two games are completely different.</h4>
