<h1>Game Theory: The Science of Strategy</h1>
    <h3>So what is Game Theory? </h3>
    <p><em>Game Theory</em>, to put it simply, is the study of competition and co-operation between two rational entities.<br>
           Usually, the "game" that is played is not meant in the recreational sense but a game is any interactive situation<br>
           with certain rules and restraints.</p>

    <h3> What are it's applications?</h3>
    <p> There have been a lot of developments in the field of Game Theory even though it is a young field. It has applications<br>
        in Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Biology and many other fields.</p>
