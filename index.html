             <h3>A brief history of Game Theory</h3>
             </div>
          <br>
             <p> Game theory is a relatively young field in computer science. It was introduced in 1928 by John Neumann who published a paper combining computational economics and mathematical modeling in his book "Theory of Games and Ecconomic behaviour".</p>
             <p>In the early 1960s there was a flurry of activity in the field and applications of Game theory was found in political science, economics and other fields.</p>
             <p>John Nash also developed the Nash equilibrium around this time, the equation which can be applied to a wide variety of games. In 2012, Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design" and, in 2014, the Nobel went to game theorist Jean Tirole.</p>
             <p>Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields, with potential applications in supercomputing, algorithms and computer engineering. It also has applications in fields outside of computer science and has been widely implemented in biology, economics, political science, philosophy among other fields.</p>

                <h3>What are zero-sum and non-zero games?</h3>
            </div>
             <br>
             <p>Zero sum game is a subset of a constant sum game where the net benefit to all the players remains constant. That is to say, that for each decision made by a player it increases or
                 decreases the resources available to other players.</p>
             <p>Essentially, the total "wins" for a player is exactly the same as the "losses" for other players. An example is Poker, where the winner recieves the precise amount lost by the other players and Chess where the piece lost by one player contributes to a corresponding win for the other player.</p>
             <p>In non-zero games, the moves made by one player does not necessarily cause a corresponding loss for other players because the net benefit can be greater than zero. This is a type of game where all players can gain or lose at the same time. In most real-life situations we consider them to be non-zero games. An example would be the Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>
             <p>Zero sum games are also called strictly competitive games whereas non-zero sum games can be competitive or co-operative.</p>

        <h2>More about why we study game theory...</h2>
        <p> What economists call game theory psychologists call the theory of social situations, which is an accurate description of what game theory is about. Although game theory is relevant to parlor games such as poker or bridge, most research in game theory focuses on how groups of people interact. There are two main branches of game theory: cooperative and noncooperative game theory. Noncooperative game theory deals largely with how intelligent individuals interact with one another in an effort to achieve their own goals. That is the branch of game theory that I will try to explain through interactive situations in this website.</p>
        <p> One way to describe a game is by listing the players (or individuals) participating in the game, and for each player, listing the alternative choices (called actions or strategies) available to that player. In the case of a two-player game, the actions of the first player form the rows, and the actions of the second player the columns, of a matrix. The entries in the matrix are two numbers representing the utility or payoff to the first and second player respectively. f neither suspect confesses, they go free, and split the proceeds of their crime which we represent by 5 units of utility for each suspect. However, if one prisoner confesses and the other does not, the prisoner who confesses testifies against the other in exchange for going free and gets the entire 10 units of utility, while the prisoner who did not confess goes to prison and which results in the low utility of -4. If both prisoners confess, then both are given a reduced term, but both are convicted, which we represent by giving each 1 unit of utility: better than having the other prisoner confess, but not so good as going free.</p>
        <p> A very famous game is the Prisoner's Dilemma game. In this game the two players are partners in a crime who have been captured by the police. Each suspect is placed in a separate cell, and offered the opportunity to confess to the crime. The game can be represented by the following matrix of payoffs</p>
